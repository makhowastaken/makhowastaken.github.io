### background -- what is a cyberdeck

Like all mediocre blogs, I'm going to start with my life story. Not for no real reason or just because I want to share but because I want to help communicate my state of mind with this so that my decisions might make a little bit more sense. There are hundreds of ways to achieve what I'm setting out to do but I chose this way because it is *what I wanted* and almost definitely not because it *is actually practical.*

So what even is a [cyberdeck?](https://hackaday.com/blog/?s=cyberdeck) A cyberdeck is a term originally coined in the mid '80s by author William Gibson (though the concept itself may originate elsewhere, idk, I wasn't there) and it is largely just a small (compared to '80s tech), portable (mostly), and powerful (enough) computer *built* for a specific task. If you've played the game [Cyberpunk 2077,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077) you've probably used one yourself or at least seen these in use. While an active part of most play styles, the player characters' cyberdecks never actually appear rendered in-game (just an item to equip in your inventory), one [does still appear in-game.](https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/comments/lm4q80/johnny_silverhands_cyberdeck_in_cyberpunk_2077/) In most fiction that has devices like this, the primary interface is virtual and thus the devices do not need explicit screens. Reality isn't fiction, however, and the software just isn't there outside of VR games (and while I do have a programming background, I ain't writing a whole UI for this project), so we'll be keeping the screen. 

I don't know when I actually started this project -- it's probably been floating around in my head since I read some of [William Gibson's books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy) in the late '00s. Even with the idea floating around in my head, I didn't actually start working on this until I started typing up this blog page. So with that in mind, let's start with a seemingly non-sequitor tangent. I like e-books. I prefer reading books off a tablet specifically. I've tried e-readers (like the kindle) but the main draw (e-ink screen) never really appealed to me so I stuck with more fully featured tablets instead so I can easily read comics/manga on the same device. It works for me and I like it and the alternative is not reading at this point so I've come to terms with it.

Over the last 11 years, I have purchased four different tablets for this purpose. All have done exactly what I wanted up until the internal batteries degraded too much. And because of who I am as a person, I kept most of these. 

### hardware donors (and more background)

The first option (and my first suitable tablet) was a [HP Stream 8.](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04497977) The alternatives at the time in my pricerange and desired specs were a second-hand first gen iPad Mini (before they came with retina displays) or a secondhand Nexus 7. Other devices weren't on my radar for whatever reason. On paper, the first gen iPad Mini looked like garbage compared to other two. Lower resolution screen, weaker looking specs, and so on. Plus, it would have had to be used to fit into my budget which also meant no real warranty. The Nexus 7 (2013) looked A LOT better than both alternatives on paper but I had already (briefly) had a Nexus 7 (2012) and just really didn't like the Android 4 experience on a tablet. Again, to fit into my price-range, it would have had to be second hand and it would have had no real warranty. Looking back, I probably should have went with this anyway. Instead, I walked over to the Microsoft Store in the mall and just bought the HP Stream 8 brand new for a bit over $100 after tax. At the time, this seemed like the best value but I soon learned that it didn't really what I wanted all that well. It was slow in 2014 (and still is today) but it did a remarkable job as an e-reader and is still technically supported in regards to software and security updates (at least until the EOL of Windows 10 in 2025) but it's way too underspecced these days to bother fixing up. It's still fully functional, including the original battery, even though I've damaged the LCD itself (just the backlight somehow -- there are spots right in the middle) and the battery only lasts about an hour. I'd want to replace the LCD and engineer a new charging and power management system because the battery will need to be replaced and this tablet has limited IO (charge port *is* the data port). Between the screen being far less than ideal and the general slowness of the device, I am not picking this tablet for this project. 

The next option is the device I replaced the HP Stream 8 with. I bought a [Xiaomi MiPad 2](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_pad_2-7770.php) (the Windows version with 64gb eMMC, not the Android version with 16gb eMMC) in 2016 ish. It seemed well reviewed at the time and the price was right. Most importantly, it fixed two of the biggest issues I had with the Stream 8, the general slowness of the tablet and the screen. It was still slow, don't get me wrong, but it was so much faster than the Stream 8. The screen though. Oh my god the screen. This device was an eye opener for me in terms of how good a tablet screen can look. The Stream 8 wasn't bad but this was just so much better. It was at this time that I started reading comics/manga too instead of just e-books. Unfortunately, the MiPad 2 has exactly zero IO on the device EXCEPT for the USB 2.0 Type C port (and a headphone jack). Yes, USB 2.0 via a Type C port. At the time, I didn't understand the implications of this, I was just happy that things were using Type C now. I tried loading comics on the device and quickly learned that I'd be constantly shuffling data on and off this device and I would have to anticipate what I wanted to read in advance since there was no expandable storage with which to store my media collection. Not an unsurmountable task but definitely tedious. 64gb was all you got and most of that was taken by the Windows install. About 13 months after purchasing, the battery capacity fell off a cliff. It went from at least two hours (that's how long I'd use it in one sitting) to less than 30 minutes so I made the decision to just sell it for parts and move on. Well. That was a journey all by itself. I couldn't restore it to factory with the recovery USB I had made when I got it because the device could not use USB devices and charge *simultaneously*. At the time, I chalked this up to me not having the proper dongles but I learned in 2020 that this was just how the device works. So I bought a parts MiPad 2 for the battery on ebay. The seller had the android version of the tablet and had managed to hard brick the device. As the seller described, it would turn on to a black screen and then sit that way until the battery died and it wasn't even detected over USB (so no ADB/fastboot options either). With seemingly no way to fix this, I just popped the rear covers off both devices and swapped the main PCB which put my 64gb windows model into the housing of the broken but otherwise pristine 16gb android version.
