### Blog?

Hey look, you found the blog I decided to start. Will I finish this? Will I maintain it? Will I update it in the future? Who knows. 

I intend to use this space for the exploratory phase of my projects whereas my youtube channel will remain the place where I show off assembly, mods, or otherwise *finished* projects. I cannot imagine that a four hour long super cut of me monologging for between 30 seconds and five minutes at a time would make for good viewing content. Instead, I'll put the research here and then show off the finished product (if I have something to even show off) later.
